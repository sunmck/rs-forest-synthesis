# Forest Structure Dynamics in Germany
## A Synthesis of RS Products

This repository contains the code and data preprocessing pipelines used in my Masterâ€™s thesis, which investigates forest structure changes across Germany from 2017 to 2023 by synthesising three selected remote sensing data products. The project focuses on analysing the effects of seven disturbance patterns on pre-disturbance, disturbance and post-disturbance forest structure. The seven disturbance patterns under analysis are:

* non-stand-replacing, stand-replacing (intensity),
* wind/bark beetle, fire, regular harvest (predominant change agent) and 
* small-scale and large-scale (size).
